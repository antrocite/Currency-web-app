Hello!

--------Run the backend server side:------------
On Linux or Mac:

1. Go to 'backend/' directory in terminal
2. $ source venv/bin/activate
   (venv)$ python app.py
3. ???
4. You should see flask server running on http://127.0.0.1:5001/ 

On Windows:

1. Go to 'backend/' directory in terminal
2. $ ./venv/Scripts/activate.bat
   $ python app.py
I'm sorry if it doesn't work. I have only tested on Linux


--------Run frontend client side--------------

1. Go to frontend/ directory in terminal
2. $ npm install 
    OR 
2. $ yarn install (probably)
3. npm audit fix (as for me, maybe you don't need it)
4. npm run serve
5. ???
6. You should see Vue server running on http://localhost:8080/
